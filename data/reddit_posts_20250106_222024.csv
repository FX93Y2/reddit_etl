You could get sprays, voice lines, skins and money. You'd think that Blizzard would be stingy and the skin drops would be low but no. I played a bit more than 300 hours of OW1, never put money into it and I almost got all the skins, in fact I had left over in game money from the lootboxes when they transitioned into Overwatch 2 because there wasn't any skins that interested me.

Fast forward to today's Overwatch and lootboxes are no more. Most of the skins are recolors of older skins and actually cool looking ones are double the price, there are upgradable cool skins but you need couple of battle passes worth of upgrade currency to get and upgrade them to the fullest. It is all designed to reward you for paying again and again and again...

I remember the last drop about lootboxes was EA's implementation in the Star Wars Battlefront 2, along with Fifa and probably many more from EA and other companies that I can't remember about, after those some countries in EU deemed it gambling and made them illegal.

I personally think OW1 lootboxes were a great rewarding strategy by Blizzard, you'd get rewarded as you played and the rewards were legitimately good. Apart from one or two specific skins(and the esport skins) that weren't even legendary quality you could get every event skin with the lootboxes or in game money that you got from the lootboxes.

I think lootboxes are a better idea than battle pass into premium skins to be bought separately in the shop strategy.",2025-01-06 22:20:24.978705
